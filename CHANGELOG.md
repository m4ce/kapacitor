# Changelog

## v0.10.0 [unreleased]

### Release Notes

This release marks the next release of Kapacitor.
With this release you can now run your own custom code for processing data within Kapacitor.
See [udf/agent/README.md](https://github.com/influxdata/kapacitor/blob/master/udf/agent/README.md) for more details.

With the addition of UDFs it is now possible to run custom anomaly detection alogrithms suited to your needs.
There are simple examples of how to use UDFs in [udf/agent/examples](https://github.com/influxdata/kapacitor/tree/master/udf/agent/examples/).

The version has jumped significantly so that it is inline with other projects in the TICK stack.
This way you can easily tell which versions of Telegraf, InfluxDB, Chronograf and Kapacitor work together.

### Release Notes

Bugfix #106 made a breaking change to the internal HTTP API. This was to facilitate integration testing and overall better design.
